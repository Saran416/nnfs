# nnfs
Multilayer Neural Network implemented completed from scratch using numpy

Activation functions: *sigmoid*
Lossfunction used: *MeanSquaredError*
Optimization algorithm used: *Gradient Descent*

**Note:** The model mostly will not perform as good as Tensorflow, PyTorch or any other popular implementations, because this implementation may not have the hyperparamters for optimum performance of the model. This was created solely for learning purpose :).
