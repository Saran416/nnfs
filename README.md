# nnfs

Multilayer Neural Network implemented completed from scratch using numpy

Activation functions: _sigmoid_

Lossfunction used: _MeanSquaredError_

Optimization algorithm used: _Gradient Descent_

**Note:** The model will not perform as good as Tensorflow, PyTorch or any other popular implementations, because this implementation may not have the hyperparamters for optimum performance of the model. This was created solely for learning purpose :).
